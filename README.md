Assignment completed by Ryan Cronin on 3/27/2017 for The Iron Yard

Updated Description 3/31/2017:
We have built upon our existing app and added testing and a build process along with checking for code coverage. The dependencies required to run the build can be found within our package.json file. We will be testing with Karma and using Mocha as our framework. 

Updated Description 3/28/2017:
Building upon the previous assignment description, we have implemented two-way data binding and built forms using angular. We have bound the form inputs to data on the controller's scope with the resulting changes appearing in the view. For this assignment we added additional inventory items to a collection of inventory to simulate a owner/operator interface to update their inventory items.


Description 3/27/2017:
This is a assignment creating a small app that tracks a stores inventory. The purpose of the assignment is to expose us to the basics of angular. We will be utilizing angular via CDN. We are creating a table displaying the inventory items name, price, quantity and color. The price factors in tax and any discounts. Discounts are noted within the table with a 'sale' icon. This assignment utilized one controller and one module.
